## How it works?
![arc knowledge diagram](https://github.com/dragonjump/mcp-ARCknowledge/raw/main/diagram.png)


This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for your custom webhook endpoints (knowledgebase).

With this you can  you can easily manage and query your list of knowledge base(webhook endpoints).
You can add new document sources by registering their URLs, and optionally provide a description and API key.

You can also list all the registered document sources and view their details.
 
When you're ready to ask/search, you can query the knowledge base with a text question  , specifying which sources to search or leaving it blank to search all of them. 

The tool will then aggregate the results from the queried sources and provide them to you.


### Prerequisites

- Go
- Python 3.6+
- Anthropic Claude Desktop app (or Cursor or Cline)
- UV (Python package manager), install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
 

## Concept
Imagine being able to bridge 1 unified setup where you can connect all your custom knowledge base endpoints webhook in one configuration, eliminating the need for multiple MCP servers.

## Setup Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install ArcKnowledge for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@dragonjump/mcp-ARCknowledge):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @dragonjump/mcp-ARCknowledge --client claude
```

1.**Clone repo**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dragonjump/mcp-arcknowledge
cd mcp-arcknowledge
```

 
2. **Configure endpoints** 
Make a copy or change`knowledge_document_sources.json`.
See `sample_endpoint` folder for references on current knowledge endpoints api schema supported. You may change the code as you wish to fit your need.

3. **Connect to the MCP server**

   Copy the below json with the appropriate {{PATH}} values:

   ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "mcp-arcknowledge": {
                "command": "cmd /c uv",
                "args": [
                    "--directory",
                    "C:/Users/Acer/OneDrive/GitHub/YourDrive",
                    "run",
                    "main.py"
                ],
                "env": {
                    "DOCUMENT_SOURCES_PATH": "C:/Users/Acer/OneDrive/GitHub/YourDrive/testcustomother.json"
                }
            }
        }
    }
   ```
For **Claude**, save this as `claude_desktop_config.json` in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   
   ```

For **Cursor**, save this as `mcp.json` in your Cursor configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/.cursor/mcp.json
   ```

For **cline**, save this as `cline_mcp_settings.json` in your configuration  

4. **Restart Client: Claude Desktop / Cursor / Cline / Windsurf**
   Open and restart your client ide for mcp. eg Claude/Cursor/Cline/etc


### Windows Compatibility

If you're running this project on Windows, be aware that `go-sqlite3` requires **CGO to be enabled** in order to compile and work properly. By default, **CGO is disabled on Windows**, so you need to explicitly enable it and have a C compiler installed.

#### Steps to get it working:

1. **Install a C compiler**  
   We recommend using [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to install a C compiler for Windows. After installing MSYS2, make sure to add the `ucrt64\bin` folder to your `PATH`.  
   → A step-by-step guide is available [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw).

 
 
## Architecture Overview

This application consists of simple main component:
 
**Python MCP Server** (`main.py`): A Python server implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which provides standardized tools client to interact with data and invoke api call.

### Data Storage

- All storage is runtime local main python server.
 

 
## Technical Details

1. Client sends requests to the Python MCP server
2. The MCP server lookup its runtime config knowledge base.
3. Then based on your queries, it calls your knowledge base endpoint api,

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues when running uv, you may need to add it to your PATH or use the full path to the executable.
- Make sure both the Go application and the Python server are running for the integration to work properly.

### Starting the Server
1. Config
Run the server in development mode:
```bash
fastmcp dev main.py
```

Or install it for use with Claude:
```bash
fastmcp install main.py
```

### Available Tools
  

#### 1. Default Loads knowledge list from knowledge_document_sources.json
Default loads knowledge sources from config
``` 
knowledge_document_sources.json
 
```
You may Load custom knowledge from mcp.json environment config

```

        "env": {
            "DOCUMENT_SOURCES_PATH": "C:/Users/Acer/OneDrive/Somewhere/YourDrive/your-custom.json"
        }
```
#### 2. List all  currently registered knowledge sources
Shows and explains the list of all registered knowledge sources.

``` 
eg. Show me my arcknowledge list 
 
```
#### 3. Add New Knowledge Document Source  
Add new arcknowledge   endpoint url document sources. 
Provide url, description purpose and apikey(if any)

``` 
eg. Add new arcknowledge data source. Endpoint is http://something.com/api/123.
Purpose is to handle questions on 123 topic. Api key is 'sk-2123123' 
 
```

#### 4. Querying Specific Knowledge Doc Source
Query the arcknowledge base built from these sources using query_knowledge_base. 

``` 
eg. Query for me my  knowledge base for product. Question is : Which is most expensive product? 


eg. Query for me my  arcknowledge base for business. Question is :When is the business established? 

eg. Query for me all my  arcknowledge base  . Question is :When is the business established? Which is most expensive product?
```
 
 
#### Tool Functions 

1.  `add_new_knowledge_document_source(url: str, description:str = None, apikey:str = None) -> str`
    *   Registers a new document source URL, optionally with a description and API key.
    *   Returns: Confirmation message with the new source ID.

2.  `list_knowledge_document_sources() -> Dict[str, Dict[str, str]]`
    *   Lists all registered document sources.
    *   Returns: Dictionary mapping source IDs to their details (URL, description, API key).

3.  `query_knowledge_base(query: str, source_ids: List[str] = [], image: str = '') -> str`
    *   Queries specified document sources (or all if none specified) with a text query and optional image data.
    *   Returns: Aggregated results from the queried sources.
